This is an AI chat tool from the Agile Wildcats team for SWFE 503, Fall 2025.

## Introduction

ChattyCatty is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** stack built with **Java + Spring Cloud + React + PostgreSQL (pgvector)**.

It comes with a **Makefile-driven developer workflow** for ingestion, reseeding, QA, and demos.
It runs in containers powered by Docker.

This is an application for serving AI responses to questions related to the University of Arizona's SWFE degrees. 

## Installation

### Requirements

1. [Git Client](http://git-scm.com)
2. [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
3. Development environment (choose one):
    1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    2. [JetBrains IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
    3. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
4. [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?) (Java builder)
5. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    1. Requires [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
        1. [Windows fix regarding WSL updates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76479583/docker-desktop-requires-a-newer-wsl-kernel-version)
        2. Ensure it's set to run on restart using Settings->General->Start Docker...
6. [Node.js and npm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js/how-to-download-and-install-node-js-and-npm/)
   1. Check the "Install the necessary tools" checkbox when installing Node.js (ex: installs Chocolatey on Windows)
7. [Make](https://medium.com/@divyeshpal07/mastering-gnu-make-and-makefiles-the-developers-guide-22df3b97cc0d)
   1. Windows: `choco install make` - if choco isn't found, go back to install Node.js above and Change the install to check the "Necessary Tools" option.
   2. Linux: `sudo apt-get install build-essential` or [Install make](https://linuxvox.com/blog/install-make-linux/)
8. [Lombok setup for your IDE](https://projectlombok.org/setup/)
9. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) for the open source AI engine

### Building the System
1. Download this codebase using the green button on the top right above that says `[<> Code]`
   1. Or switch to the required branch `git checkout existing-branch` 
2. Prepare the environment:
   1. See the [DEV_COMMANDS](DEV-COMMANDS.md) for the most updated `.env` file definition.
3. Ensure the dependent services are running:
   1. Docker (Desktop)
   2. Ollama
4. Execute the makefile command to spin up docker containers for the DB, API, and frontend:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project
   cd chatty-catty
   # Use make to create and deploy docker containers
   make clean dev
   ```
5. The following container names are now available in docker:
   * `ragdb`: The Postgres database as defined in the .env file.
   * `chatty-catty-app`: The API tier, visible on localhost:8080 by default.
   * `chatty-catty-frontend`: The UI tier, listening on localhost:3000 by default.

## Testing It Out
* Open a browser to the following url to view the frontend: http://localhost:3000
* Joke endpoint for verifying the backend has the right AI configuration: http://localhost:8080/chat/general?message=Tell%20me%20a%20joke
* View the REST API endpoints for direct API testing using [POSTMAN](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/overview/) or other integration:
  * View directly in browser http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
  * Download the REST JSON API http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs
  * Download as yaml file http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml

NOTE: Add documents into the `docs` folder for automatic ingestion into RAG.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Start dev stack:
   ```bash
   make dev
   # or
   make clean dev
   ```
2. Ingest docs (requires admin JWT):
   ```bash
   make reseed-logs
   ```
5. Run QA checks:
   ```bash
   make qa-full
   ```

### üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
* Backend: Java 24 + Spring Cloud 6 + JPA
* Database: PostgreSQL + pgvector
* Frontend: React + Axios
* Ingestion: PDF/TXT/Markdown parsing + AI embeddings to vector database
* Dev Tools: Docker Compose + Makefile
* AI provider: Ollama
* The containers are used for the system:
  * ragdb - The database
  * chatty-catty-frontend - The UI tier
  * chatty-catty-app - The API tier

### üéâ Demo-Ready
ChattyCatty is developer-friendly and presentation-ready:

* ASCII art banners in demo/dev commands
* One-command demo setup (make demo or make demo-auto)
* Built-in QA + monitoring
