This is an AI chat tool from the Agile Wildcats team for SWFE 503, Fall 2025.

## Introduction

ChattyCatty is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** stack built with **Java + Spring Boot + React + PostgreSQL (pgvector)**.

It comes with a **Makefile-driven developer workflow** for ingestion, reseeding, QA, and demos.
It runs in Virtual Machines (VMs) powered by Docker.

This is an application for serving AI responses to questions related to the University of Arizona's SWFE degrees. 

## Installation

### Requirements

1. [Git Client](http://git-scm.com)
2. [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
3. Development environment (choose one):
    1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    2. [JetBrains IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
    3. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
4. [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?) (Java builder)
5. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    1. Requires [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
        1. [Windows fix regarding WSL updates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76479583/docker-desktop-requires-a-newer-wsl-kernel-version)
        2. Ensure it's set to run on restart using Settings->General->Start Docker...
6. [Node.js and npm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js/how-to-download-and-install-node-js-and-npm/)
   1. Check the "Install the necessary tools" checkbox when installing Node.js (ex: installs Chocolatey on Windows)
7. [Make](https://medium.com/@divyeshpal07/mastering-gnu-make-and-makefiles-the-developers-guide-22df3b97cc0d)
   1. Windows: `choco install make` - if choco isn't found, go back to install Node.js above and Change the install to check the "Necessary Tools" option.
   2. Linux: `sudo apt-get install build-essential` or [Install make](https://linuxvox.com/blog/install-make-linux/)
8. [Lombok setup for your IDE](https://projectlombok.org/setup/)
9. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) for the open source AI engine

### Building the System
1. Download this codebase using the green button on the top right above that says `[<> Code]`
2. Prepare the environment:
   1. Create a file in the project root called .env and fill it with the following info:
   ```
   POSTGRES_INSTANCE=ragdb
   POSTGRES_SERVER=localhost:5432
   POSTGRES_SERVER_SPRING=postgres:5432
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
   SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
   ```
   2. This should be done the first time and repeated whenever maven or npm dependencies are changed. 
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project
   cd chatty-catty

   # Install dependencies
   mvn clean install
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```
3. Execute the makefile command to spin up docker VMs for the DB, API, and frontend:
   ```bash
   make clean dev
   ```
   This command builds and starts the VMS:
   * ragdb: The database
   * chatty-catty-app - The API tier
   * chatty-catty-frontend - The UI tier
4. Ensure ollama is running before executing commands in the frontend.

## Troubleshooting

* If docker complains about mvnw, use `dos2unix mvnw` in the project root directory
* Errors with missing table, delete the ragdb container from Docker and then run `mvn clean install`

## Testing It Out
* Open a browser to the following url to view the frontend: http://localhost:3000
* Joke endpoint for verifying the backend has the right OPENAI API KEY: http://localhost:8080/chat/general?message=Tell%20me%20a%20joke
* View the REST API endpoints for direct API testing using [POSTMAN](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/overview/) or other integration:
  * View directly in browser http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
  * Download the REST JSON API http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs
  * Download as yaml file http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml

NOTE: Add documents into the docs folder for automatic ingestion into RAG.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Start dev stack:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
2. Ingest docs (requires admin JWT):
   ```bash
   make reseed-logs
   ```
5. Run QA checks:
   ```bash
   make qa-full
   ```

### Developer Usage

See the [DEV_COMMANDS](DEV-COMMANDS.md) file for the full list and explanation of Makefile commands.

### üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
* Backend: Java 24 + Spring Boot 6 + JPA
* Database: PostgreSQL + pgvector
* Frontend: React + Axios
* Ingestion: PDF/TXT/Markdown parsing + OpenAI embeddings
* Dev Tools: Docker Compose + Makefile
* AI provider: Ollama
* The VMs are used for the system:
  * ragdb - The database
  * chatty-catty-frontend - The UI tier
  * chatty-catty-app - The API tier

### üéâ Demo-Ready
ChattyCatty is developer-friendly and presentation-ready:

* ASCII art banners in demo/dev commands
* One-command demo setup (make demo or make demo-auto)
* Built-in QA + monitoring
